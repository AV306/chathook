# chathook

A logical server mod that forwards Minecraft chat, game and command messages to a Discord webhook.

## How to Use

Create a file called `secrets.txt` in the root of your server (in the same folder as the `server.jar`. 

In the file, write the following line:

> `webhook_url=[your webhook url here]`

The webhook URL should be in the form of `(todo)`.

Now, just fire up the server and you're all set!
